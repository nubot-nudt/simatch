Welcome anyone to add somthing to this list or pick some items from it and contribute to this code.

short-term:
1. consider the physical limits of robots; (easy)
2. limit the acceleration of the goal keeper;(easy)

long-term:
1. Add a physical simulation model for kicking mechanism.  (hard)
2. Add a physical simulation model for dribble mechanism.  (hard) 
3. set up a virtule runtime environment; refer to Matlab's support for RoboCup; (hard)
4. show role labels beside each robot; show the positioning points; (medium)
5. consider the world information each robot is able to obtain; (medium)
6. Add a GUI to configure parameters, e.g. robot numbers, model path, etc. (medium)
7. let players design the flight path of the soccer ball in a lob shot; (easy)
8. programmatically assign numbers to robots in Gazebo; refer to an email from a portuguess team;
9. Create a GUI that is able to insert cyan/magenta robots with custom name and pose.
